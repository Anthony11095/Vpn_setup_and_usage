# VPN Lab: Using Azure VM and ProtonVPN to Observe IP and Geolocation Changes

## Technologies Used
- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines, Resource Groups)
- Windows 10 (Virtual Machine OS)
- ProtonVPN (VPN service)
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
- https://whatismyipaddress.com (IP geolocation lookup)
- Web Browsers (Google, Disney, Amazon)

## Prerequisites
- Microsoft Azure account with permission to create resources
- Basic familiarity with Azure Portal and VM setup
- Remote Desktop access (RDP)
- Internet connection
- ProtonVPN free account ([Sign up here](https://account.protonvpn.com/signup?plan=free&language=en))
- Text editor (e.g., Notepad) to log IP addresses

## What This Lab Does

This lab demonstrates how VPNs can be used to mask your IP address and simulate browsing from different geographic regions. You will create a Windows 10 virtual machine in Azure, connect to it via Remote Desktop, and test how ProtonVPN can change your visible IP address and location. You'll record and compare IP addresses before and after using the VPN.
